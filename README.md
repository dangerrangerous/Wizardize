Unity 3D game in progress
This started as a spinoff of Sebastian Lague's TD shooter series and is growing into an adventure game filled with sockgnomes,
treetures, bugs, potions, a ring bear, and more. Thanks to the people who post online resources, tutorials, talks etc.

If and when I lock down a camera system I like I'll see if I can put together a quick tut of how I did it.

But for now there are other errors to be worked out.
